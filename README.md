# YelpSearch
Yelp Search API Test Project

#### Some basic assumptions
- use fixed term & location & limit (pizza, 111 sutter st, san francisco, 50)
- don't expect getting nothing from the server 
- don't expect the timeout request 
- don;t expect poor network connection 

#### Architecture 
MVVM + CLEAN 

#### Tests
- unit tests 
- scenario tests 

#### Todo 
- fine-tune UI
- DI 
- modularization
